# Promesse

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/djfm/promesse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/djfm/promesse)

*Promesse* is a [Promises/A+](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests) compliant Promise library.

I've written it because I love promises in JS and I like to know how the tools I use work.
Besides, it's a nice exercise to work against an existing **huge** test suite.
